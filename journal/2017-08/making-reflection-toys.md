# Making Toys - Why should we care?
* Wouldn’t you like to see a world where…
* We don’t simply write code to create systems, but to explain and reify ideas so people can play with them?
* We can spend more time at work making toys that let us experiment with 10x ideas.
* Work with tools that multiply a team’s diverse set of perspectives because they a kind of “type checking” for ideas?
* Wouldn’t you like to see this shitty thing changed?
* Tests made more fun and relevant to production systems
* Miscommunication of requirements for the team (Autogen UI with code)
* Documentation that automatically updates because it’s interwoven in the implementation.
* Wouldn’t you like a more fun way to write tests?
* Wouldn’t you like a clearer way to debug someone else’s system?
* Wouldn’t you like a clearer way for your business analyst, project manager, or tester to understand what you do?
* Wouldn't you like a system that helps you prevent management from driving your software into the ground?
* Avoid making improvements that don't end up making much of a difference.
* “How can we sustain human understanding as complexity grows and the team changes?”
