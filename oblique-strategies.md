# Oblique Strategies

In 1975, Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt began selling a deck of printed cards to help musicians and artists break
creative blocks.  Each card offers a challenging constraint or idea to that encourages lateral thinking.

## A Programmer's Deck of Cards

* Remove a feature
* Write it in pseudo code
* Start with data types
* Create an imperative program, then refactor out the functional parts
* Abuse a language feature
* Go to an extreme and come back to a comfortable place
* Ask somebody what they'd do
* Half-solve it:  Give it to somebody else
* Sketch it and explain it to somebody else
* Delete something and write it again
* Do the last thing first
