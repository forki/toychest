# Toy Making - Filling up the Toy Chest

------------------------------------------------------

## What's the big idea?

The goal is for us to make something small and fun.  Ideally, your project should be at least one of these things:

* Easy to share
* Unprofessional
* Non-rigorous
* Not particularly impressive
* Whimsicle 
* Violates code standards
* Half-conceived
* A work-in-progress
* Broken
* Just a model or a picture

## Agenda

* 15 minutes - to go over ideas and materials
 * Fun for grown ups - A review
 * A quick overview of the toys you can play with
* 90 minutes - Play time
* 15-20 minutes - Optional show-and-tell

At the end, we want to encourage you to share your thing *somewhere*.

## What do you need?

* A device capable of compiling F#
* [Any F# editor](tools.md) - The more the better.  I used LINQPad a lot, but it's not necessary.
* Something you want to share

## What kind of thing can I share?

I want to encourage you to be really creative and try something.  Anything.

* [Small prototypes](code-snippets/patterns/singleton-maker.fsx)
* A snippet showing how to use your favorite library or tool
* A screencast
* A small koan
* An open problem for other people to solve
* A data model that's expressed nicely in F#
* A 5 minute slide deck

## Don't want to make something?

* We'll have planty of things to play with - Give us your feedback
* Play with something and tell someone what you like and don't like.

## Stuck?

* What's the minimum thing you can do to get your idea our there so people can play with it?
* How can you distill an idea to its essence so you can tweet it?
* What are some way you can share incomplete ideas that others can pick up?
* [Try some of these strategies](oblique-strategies.md)
