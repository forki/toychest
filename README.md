# Toy Making - Filling up the Toy Chest

* What's the minimum thing you can do to get your idea our there so people can play with it?
* How can you distill an idea to its essence so you can tweet it?
* What are some way you can share incomplete ideas that others can pick up?

We'll start off with a brief talk/discussion, but bring your laptop some ideas or maybe
something you'd like to share.  We're going to hack away with one singular goal:

**Make something small and/or broken and share it!**

## What do you need?

* A device capable of compiling F#
* [Any F# editor](tools.md)
* Something you want to share

## What kind of thing can I share?

I want to encourage you to be really creative and try something.

* Small prototypes
* A snippet showing how to use your favorite library or tool
* A screencast
* A small koan
* An open problem for other people to solve
* A data model that's expressed nicely in F#
* A 5 minute slide deck

## Don't want to make something?

* We'll have planty of things to play with - Give us your feedback
* Play with something and tell someone what you like and don't like.
